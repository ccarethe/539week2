            <h3>Geographical Location</h3>
            <p>Yellowstone National Park is located in the United States. It is mostly within Wisconsin, with parts in Montana and Idaho.</p>
            <p>Yellowstone is the world's first national park! It covers 2.2 million acres of land. Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872 under the Yellowstone Natinoal Park Protection Act signed by President Ulysses S. Grant. The park is known for its natural beauty and diverse wildlife.</p>
            <p>Organized exploration of the land did not begin until the 1860s. It is important to note Native populations have lived on the land for over 11,000 years, way before it was designated as a national park.</p>
